# AI Chatbot

This is a chatbot that was developed for the Georgia Tech class CSC-7637 Knowledge Based AI. 

The goal of this project is to create a text based conversational agent capable of providing the user their desired information. The chatbot's domain is limited to the provide corpus in the code base (TODO: Fill file name here)

##### How it works?
The user will ask the chatbot a question, the chatbot either provides an answer or asks the user for more information.  The chatbot should learn while interacting with the user to provide better answers the more the chatbot is used.
